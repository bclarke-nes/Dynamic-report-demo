# Dynamic report demo

Dynamic reports are data-driven documents that can be periodically updated as their underlying data changes.

This resource is a brief introduction to writing dynamic reports using [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), and [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud). It is designed to be used across several small-group interactive sessions, and is specifically designed for those without previous programming experience who work in health and care. It gives a general introduction to the tools, and then some useful examples of frequently-met data-driven tasks. It is intended as a starting point for automating your report writing processes, with the aim of replacing, enhancing, or simplifying, manual report writing. The demonstration also covers ways of producing the report in a variety of formats including .pdf, .docx (Word format), and .html (webpage).

Some examples of routine reports that might be targets for re-working in a dynamic format:

- service-use reports (admission figures, bed utilisation)
- annual reports (public health annual reports)
- engagement and impact data (training, outreach)

## Who is this demo for?
This learning resource is intended for someone who:

+ is currently spending lots of time manually updating reports in health, care, or housing
+ **and** would like to reduce the time spent on this routine work over the medium-term (months)
+ **and** has some time to spend reworking this report-writing process 
+ **and** are open to gaining some basic programming experience

Note too that it is a learning resource. You'll need some time to read this introduction and get set for the training session, as well as for the two hour training session itself. 

## What this demo is not

+ it's not a full introduction to working in [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is deep (like most analytic platforms), and this demonstration covers only a little bit of the available functionality
+ it's not an introduction to everything that you might like to do with a data-driven report either. Instead, it covers some simple examples of common tasks as a way of familiarising you with a different workflow
+ it's definitely not a production-ready replacement for your existing reports. It's a learning resource, rather than a pre-packed replacement
+ it won't teach you how to make real-time dashboards. If you need your report to update more than about once a day, you should consider building a dashboard instead ([Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-gb/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), or [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/))

It's written with health, care, and housing staff in mind, and is produced by NHS Education for Scotland's Digitally Enabled Workforce programme.

It's currently undergoing testing, and is subject to frequent revision.
